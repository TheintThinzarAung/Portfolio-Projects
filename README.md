# Portfolio-Projects
This repository is a curated collection of my best projects, selected from my various repositories like**Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, **Power BI Dashboards**, **SQL**, and **Capstone Projects**. It serves as a showcase for my skills and abilities in data analysis, machine learning, business intelligence, and more.


## Projects:

### Data Analysis Projects:
- **Titanic Data Analysis**: An exploration and predictive analysis of Titanic passenger data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to predict survival rates based on various factors.

### Machine Learning Projects:
- **[Project Name]**: [Brief description of the ML project showcasing predictive modeling and algorithm implementation.]

### Power BI Dashboards:
- **[Project Name]**: [Brief description of Power BI dashboard showcasing data visualization and interactive reporting.]

### SQL Projects:
- **[Project Name]**: [Brief description of SQL project demonstrating data querying, manipulation, and reporting using SQL.]

### Capstone Projects:
- **[Capstone Project Name]**: [Brief description of a large project combining machine learning, data analysis, and business intelligence to solve a real-world problem.]

## Technologies:
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools**: Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Others**: DAX, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Preprocessing

## Folder Structure:
- **projects/**: The folder containing the actual projects from each domain (Data Analysis, ML, Power BI, SQL, Capstone).
