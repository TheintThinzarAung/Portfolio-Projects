# 🏗️ Construction Cost, Delay & Vendor Analysis

This project simulates real-world experience as a **Data Analyst** at a tech-enabled construction firm. I worked cross-functionally with operations and finance to uncover cost overruns, delay drivers, and vendor inefficiencies — then built a Power BI solution to support smarter decisions.

🛠️ Tools: Power BI · SQL · DAX · Excel
